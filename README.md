## Application for converting roman numbers into arabic numbers.  

Right now that is a console application, but i'm planning to make a simple interface.  

> converting_roman_numbers.py uses match-case statements that were implemented in python 3.10  

The syntax:
```
match term:  
  case pattern-1:  
    action-1  
  case pattern-2:  
    action-2
  case pattern-3:
    action-3
  case _:  
    action-default
```
