## Application for converting roman numbers into arabic numbers.  

Made with `customtkinter` for modern and simple user interface. 
The icons folder has two options.

#### How it looks:

> function for converting numbers uses match-case statements that were implemented in python 3.10  

The syntax:
```
match term:  
  case pattern-1:  
    action-1  
  case pattern-2:  
    action-2
  case pattern-3:
    action-3
  case _:  
    action-default
```

Currently the application is written in one file, which is a little bit big, i'm planning on separating interface part from the converting numbers part of the program.
